# Understanding Core Concepts of LangGraph (Deep Dive)

In the [last chapter](https://dev.to/raunaklallala/langgraph-vs-chains-building-smarter-ai-workflows-with-state-branching-and-memory-56dd?preview=a3b0cc9225d9424df3488f81a91f12cdb0aa5491fd423d314307a209669dfaae1724d8416dd9b88431ddd3575e383685253544f0b5b84d04116904f6), we talked about why LangGraph feels like a shift compared to traditional “linear chains.” Now, let’s slow down and zoom into its *DNA*. At the core, LangGraph has three simple but powerful building blocks: **Nodes, Edges, and State**.  

If those names sound abstract, don’t worry, by the end of this chapter, you’ll see them the same way you see apps on your phone or stops on a subway map. They’re pieces you already know, just arranged in a smarter way.

### 1. Nodes: The Execution Units  

A Node is basically “a single action.” Imagine breaking your workday into steps: checking email, making coffee, writing code, or scheduling a meeting. Each of those is a *Node*.  

In LangGraph, a Node can be many things:  
- A large language model call (like GPT, Gemini, or LLaMA).  
- A tool (search engine lookup, calculator, weather API, database query).  
- A custom function (Python function, regex cleaner, summarizer).  

Each Node is like a worker with a simple contract: it takes an input, does its piece of the job, and pushes out an output.  

 **Everyday example:**  
Think about ordering food on a delivery app.  
- One Node takes your food order.  
- Another Node calls the restaurant’s system.  
- Another Node calculates delivery time.  
Each does one thing, and together they create your experience.  

**Analogy:** Nodes are like “stations” on a metro map. The passenger (your data) steps off at every station, something happens to them, and then they move along.

### 2.Edges: The Flow of Control  

Nodes mean nothing without connections. That’s where Edges come in—they define how data flows between steps.  

Think of Edges as “decision pathways.” Sometimes they’re simple, sometimes they’re smart.  

**Types of edges:**  
- Deterministic: Always go from Node A → Node B.  
- Conditional: Choose the next Node depending on logic (like: if temperature > 30°C → recommend ice cream, else → recommend coffee).  
- Looping: Keep retrying until a condition is satisfied (like refreshing a page until tickets become available).  

**Everyday example:**  
Picture a customer support chatbot:  
- If you say “My internet is down,” the Edge routes you to technical troubleshooting.  
- If you say “I want to upgrade my plan,” the Edge routes you to subscription details.  
Same system—different path, depending on your input.  

**Analogy:** If Nodes are stations, Edges are the railway tracks. They decide where the train (data) should head next.

### 3. State: Memory That Persists  

This is where LangGraph flexes its muscles. State is memory. It’s what makes the system feel alive, instead of robotic.  

In traditional chains (LangChain’s default way), once the step is done, the memory is gone. LangGraph changes that by carrying context across all steps—even across *different* runs of the workflow.  

**Types of state:**  
- Short-term state → like scratch notes (e.g., storing your last reply).  
- Long-term state → like preferences you always want remembered (favorite language, tone, or settings).  
- Shared state → memory that’s accessible to *all* nodes during execution.  

**Everyday example:**  
Think of Netflix. It remembers what you watched last night, even if you close the app. That’s State. Without it, every time you logged in it would say: “Hello, stranger. Want to start from Season 1 again?”  

In LLM workflows, this is a game changer. Suddenly your AI assistant can remember your name, your last three queries, and the fact that you hate super-long formal emails.  

**Analogy:** State is your personal notebook. Instead of starting from scratch each time, the AI flips back a few pages and says: *“Ah, I remember what we were doing.”*

### 4. Putting It All Together (Mini Example)  

Let’s imagine a Translator Graph:  

- **Node 1:** Input Capture → User enters “Hello World.”  
- **Node 2:** Translator LLM → Converts to French (“Bonjour le monde”).  
- **Edge:** Pass result forward.  
- **Node 3:** Output Formatter → Returns polished, styled output.  
- **State:** Stores both “Hello World” and “Bonjour le monde” for reference.  

📊 **Mental diagram:**  


**INSERT DIAGRAM HERE **
```
[User Input] → [Translator Node] → [Formatter Node]  
        |                     |  
   (state: "Hello")    (state: "Bonjour le monde")  
```

Now layer this with something real: imagine building a **job application assistant**:  
- Node 1: Parse candidate resume.  
- Node 2: Summarize applicant strengths.  
- Node 3: Match with a job description.  
- Edges: If skills gap detected → route to skill-gap explainer node.  
- State: Stores both the resume context and job descriptions for continuity.  

That’s not just a chatbot, infact it’s a real system that **“remembers”** and adapts.

## Why These Concepts Matter  

Once you start thinking in terms of Nodes, Edges, and State, you realize this is less about AI “chats” and more about *AI workflows*.  

- Nodes let you modularize logic (build small, reusable steps).  
- Edges let you branch and adapt (no more rigid scripts).  
- State gives your system context, continuity, and memory—making it feel closer to an intelligent colleague than a forgetful bot.  

For me personally, the **State** part was what made pieces click. The first time I built a system that could remember user preferences *across sessions*—like “always reply in bullet points unless I say otherwise”—it felt like a leap. Suddenly, it wasn’t just a chatbot anymore. It was my *teammate*.  

This trio (Nodes, Edges, State) is why LangGraph isn’t just a library, but a framework for *persistent, adaptive, multi-step systems* you can actually trust.
