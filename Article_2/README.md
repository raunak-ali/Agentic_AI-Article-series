# Article 2: Single Agent Workflow — From LLMs to LangGraph
---
## 1. What is LangGraph & Why It’s a Step Towards Agentic AI 



## 2.Agents Using LangGraph



## 3. Core Concepts of LangGraph (Deep Dive)

Nodes → execution units (LLM, tool, function).

Edges → directional flow (data + control passing).

State → the "memory" that persists as the graph executes.

Examples + diagrams for each:

Node = a translator agent.

Edge = flow from input → LLM → output.

State = stores the original + translated text.

## 4.  LangGraph Studio (Hands-on Intro)


## 5. Hands-On Setup

Prerequisites (Python, pip/venv, API key from Google AI).

Install LangGraph + LangChain + LangGraph Studio.

Quick sanity check: pip install langgraph langchain langgraph-cli.

## 7. Practical: Building Our First LangGraph

One Node Graph example:

Input: a sentence.

Node: an LLM that translates it into Shakespearean English.

Edge: connects input → output.

State: stores original + translated versions.

Visualization in LangGraph Studio.

## 8. Limitations & Considerations

Current limitations of LangGraph (still young, evolving).

Overheads vs simple LangChain Chains (when NOT to use LangGraph).

Need for structured thinking in workflows (not for every task).

## 9. Teaser for Next Article

Next: Tools + Multi-Agent Systems.

Show how nodes can call external APIs, calculators, RAG pipelines.

Transition: from single-agent graph → multi-agent collaboration.

# Todo:-  Add Agent Types->Simple-Reflex,Model-based,Goal-based
