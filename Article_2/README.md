# Article 2: Single Agent Workflow — From LLMs to LangGraph
---
## 1. Recap & Transition

Quick refresher on what we covered in Article 1 (prompting → agents → LangChain basics).

Why we now need LangGraph to move beyond linear chains.

## 2. What is LangGraph?

Define LangGraph: framework built on LangChain for stateful, graph-based workflows.

Explain why it matters: moves from simple LLM calls → structured reasoning graphs.

Difference between:

LangChain LLM Chains (linear, stateless).

LangGraph Graphs (nodes, states, edges, branching logic, persistence).

## 3. Core Concepts of LangGraph (Deep Dive)

Nodes → execution units (LLM, tool, function).

Edges → directional flow (data + control passing).

State → the "memory" that persists as the graph executes.

Examples + diagrams for each:

Node = a translator agent.

Edge = flow from input → LLM → output.

State = stores the original + translated text.

## 4. Why LangGraph is a Step Towards Agentic AI

Graph structure = decision-making + reasoning flow, not just text prediction.

Agents become composable building blocks inside graphs.

Enables:

Multi-step reasoning.

Long-term memory + persistence.

Multi-agent collaboration.

## 5. LangGraph Studio (Hands-on Intro)

Explain LangGraph Studio UI.

Why visualization is powerful (see your agents/nodes/edges live).

Use case: debugging workflows + collaboration in teams.

Link official docs.

## 6. Hands-On Setup

Prerequisites (Python, pip/venv, API key from Google AI).

Install LangGraph + LangChain + LangGraph Studio.

Quick sanity check: pip install langgraph langchain langgraph-cli.

## 7. Practical: Building Our First LangGraph

One Node Graph example:

Input: a sentence.

Node: an LLM that translates it into Shakespearean English.

Edge: connects input → output.

State: stores original + translated versions.

Visualization in LangGraph Studio.

## 8. Limitations & Considerations

Current limitations of LangGraph (still young, evolving).

Overheads vs simple LangChain Chains (when NOT to use LangGraph).

Need for structured thinking in workflows (not for every task).

## 9. Teaser for Next Article

Next: Tools + Multi-Agent Systems.

Show how nodes can call external APIs, calculators, RAG pipelines.

Transition: from single-agent graph → multi-agent collaboration.
