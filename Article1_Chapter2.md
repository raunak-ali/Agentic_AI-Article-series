# Chapter 2: Introduction to LLMs And Free LLM Resources

---

## üîπ 1. What Are LLMs (Large Language Models)?

Imagine a system that doesn‚Äôt just store information like a database, but can converse, summarize, translate, write code, and even reason through problems. That‚Äôs what an LLM (Large Language Model) does.
* To a **business owner**: You can think of them as engines that can draft reports, analyze long documents, summarize meetings, or even generate marketing content at scale‚Äîcutting both cost and time.
* To a **student or fresher**: It‚Äôs helpful to imagine them as a much smarter autocomplete. They‚Äôve been trained on massive datasets, so they can predict the ‚Äúnext word‚Äù in a way that feels surprisingly natural, whether you‚Äôre writing code, a paragraph, or even a story.

## üîπ 2. How Do LLMs Work (Architecture Basics)

At the core of most modern LLMs is the **Transformer architecture** (Vaswani et al., 2017). 
Unlike older models that processed text one word at a time, transformers look at whole sequences in parallel and figure out which words matter most to each other. Here are the essentials: 
- **Embeddings** ‚Äì Words (or tokens) are turned into numerical vectors that capture meaning.
- **Positional Encoding** ‚Äì Adds information about word order (since transformers don‚Äôt read sequentially by default).
- **Self-Attention** ‚Äì Each word decides which other words in the sentence it should *pay attention* to.
- **Multi-Head Attention** ‚Äì Multiple attention mechanisms run in parallel, capturing different patterns (syntax, context, semantics).
- **Feed-Forward Layers + Residuals** ‚Äì Nonlinear layers stacked deep, with shortcut connections to keep training stable.
- **Output Layer** ‚Äì Predicts the most likely next token, repeating the process to generate full sentences.

That‚Äôs the backbone: a stack of transformer blocks working together, with **more layers = more power**.

## üîπ 3. Types of LLMs

* **Decoder-only (GPT-style)** ‚Üí Text generation, chat, coding.
* **Encoder-only (BERT-style)** ‚Üí Text classification, embeddings, search.
* **Encoder-Decoder (T5/FLAN-style)** ‚Üí Translation, summarization, Q\&A.
* **Instruction-tuned models** ‚Üí Optimized for the following natural language prompts (e.g., Mistral-Instruct, Falcon-Instruct,Gemini).

## üîπ 4. Accessing Open-Source LLMs on Hugging Face

Hugging Face hosts 100,000+ models. Some are fully open, others are **gated**.

‚úÖ To use **gated models** like Mistral or LLaMA:

1. Visit the model‚Äôs page (e.g., [Mistral-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1))
2. Click **‚ÄúAccess repository‚Äù** and accept the license.
3. Generate a **Read token** here ‚Üí [HF Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
4. Authenticate in notebook:

   ```python
   from huggingface_hub import login
   login("YOUR_HF_TOKEN")
   ```

## üîπ 5. Running a Free LLM (Google AI Studio)

Instead of heavy Hugging Face models, you can start quickly with **Google AI Studio** ‚Üí free API keys, fast responses.

üëâ Try it here: [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### **Step 1: Get API Key**

1. Go to [Google AI Studio Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Generate a free API key.
3. Copy it.

### **Step 2: Use in Notebook**

```python
!pip install -q -U google-genai

from google import genai

# The client gets the API key from the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
client = genai.Client(api_key="AIzaSyBEhOoTh2Iu2UzC1p8Kfz8pL4FxGQP1F_w")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash", contents="Explain All about LLMS"
)
print(response.text)
```

## üîπ 7. Limitations of Free LLMs

* **Rate limits** ‚Üí Free APIs (Google AI, Hugging Face) restrict daily usage.
* **Model size** ‚Üí Smaller free/open models may give weaker answers vs GPT-4/Gemini Pro.
* **Latency** ‚Üí Free cloud GPUs can be slow (Colab queues, Hugging Face load times).
* **Privacy** ‚Üí Using free APIs means your inputs may be logged. For sensitive use cases, local/offline models are safer.
