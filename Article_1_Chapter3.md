# Chapter 3: Basics of Prompt Engineering

---

🔹 **1. What Is Prompt Engineering?**

Prompt Engineering is basically how you “speak AI” so it actually understands you.  
As a student or fresher, think of it like framing your questions to a teacher clearly so you get the best answer.  
As a business leader, it’s about giving your AI “assistant” the exact instruction it needs—no guesswork, just action.


---

🔹 **2. Why Prompt Engineering Is Important**

- **Accuracy** — You get relevant, sharp responses, not hallucinations.
- **Consistency** — The AI understands what you want, every time.
- **Efficiency** — Fewer rewrites, faster results.
- **Control** — You guide tone, structure, and style.

🔹 **3. Core Prompting Techniques**

**(a) Zero-Shot Prompting**  
Ask directly, no setup.  
*Example:* What is the capital of Brazil?  
Great for simple questions.  
Not always reliable if your prompt is vague.

**(b) Few-Shot Prompting**  
You show the model how to do it, then ask.  
*Example:*  
Translate to French:  
1. I love programming. → J'adore la programmation.  
2. This food is delicious. → Cette nourriture est délicieuse.

Now translate: “Where is the nearest train station?”  
Excellent for establishing format.  
Builds “pattern understanding” quickly.

**(c) Role Prompting**  
You assign the model a persona or expertise.  
*Example:*  
You are a professional business consultant.  
Suggest three cost-saving strategies for a small retail store.  
Directs tone and domain.  
Especially powerful for business-facing output.

**(d) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**  
Encourage the model to think step by step.  
*Example:*  
A train leaves at 3 PM traveling 60 km/h. Another leaves at 4 PM traveling 80 km/h.  
When does the second catch up? Think step by step.  
Great for math and logic tasks.  
But small models may struggle to maintain coherence.

**(e) Instruction-Tuning vs Prompting**  
Instruction-tuned models (like Mistral-Instruct, Falcon-Instruct, Gemini Flash) are better at following concise prompts.  
Still—how you ask matters. Even the best models can misinterpret sloppy instructions.

🔹 **4. The PROMPT Method — A Practical Framework**

- **P** — Provide context (who, what, why)
- **R** — Role (persona or expertise level)
- **O** — Output format (bullet list, essay, JSON, etc.)
- **M** — Models/examples (few-shot if needed)
- **P** — Point out constraints (length, style, tone)
- **T** — Test & tweak iteratively

*Sample Business Prompt (using PROMPT):*  
You are a marketing strategist.  
Write a LinkedIn post (100 words max, professional tone) about why small businesses should start using AI-powered chatbots.  
Include 3 bullet points with key benefits at the end.  
That covers all elements—context, role, format, constraints.

🔹 **5. Use Cases — Who Benefits and How?**

| Audience    | Use Cases                                                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Business    | Client proposals, marketing copy, market summaries, brainstorming ideas |
| Students    | Summarizing lectures, generating practice questions, debugging code, translating and simplifying concepts |


---

🔹 **6. Common Prompting Mistakes (and Fixes)**

- **Too vague:**  
  “Write something about AI.”  
  → Better: “Write a 200-word introduction to AI for high-school students, with three real-world examples.”

- **No structure:**  
  “Summarize this article.”  
  → Better: “Summarize this article in five bullet points, each under 15 words.”

- **Overloaded prompt:**  
  Asking multiple unrelated tasks at once  
  → Better: Break them into separate prompts to stay clear.

### Limitations of Prompt Engineering (With Models)

| Issue                | Examples                    | What Happens                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Hallucinations       | LLaMA-2-7B, Mistral-7B     | AI confidently states incorrect “facts.”              |
| Weak reasoning       | DistilGPT-2, GPT4All       | Chain-of-Thought fails; logic falls apart.            |
| Poor instruction follow | Falcon-7B, LLaMA-2-Base | Ignores role or tone instructions.                    |
| Small context window | GPT-NeoX-20B, DistilGPT2   | Cannot summarize long documents.                      |
| Bias / tone issues   | RedPajama-INCITE, Pythia   | Unfiltered models may produce off-color responses.     |
| Free-tier limitations | Google AI Studio free tier, Hugging Face Spaces | Lower rate limits or slow response times during peak usage. |

This is why prompt engineering isn’t optional — it helps you get more out of limited or smaller models.

🔹 **7. Prompt Chaining — Breaking Down Complex Tasks**

Sometimes a single prompt isn’t enough. That’s where Prompt Chaining comes in—breaking a complex request into smaller steps, feeding outputs from one step into the next.  
Think of it as building a pipeline: Prompt → Response → Refined Prompt → Final Output.

**Example 1 — Business Case**  
*Task:* “Write a business strategy for launching an eco-friendly fashion brand.”  
*Chained Approach:*  
- Prompt 1 → “List 5 challenges eco-fashion startups face.”  
- Prompt 2 → “Suggest 3 strategies to overcome each challenge.”  
- Prompt 3 → “Combine into a polished 500-word strategy report.”  
Instead of dumping one big prompt, you steer the model step-by-step, ensuring quality at each stage.

**Example 2 — Student Case**  
*Task:* “Write an essay on climate change.”  
*Chained Approach:*  
- Prompt 1 → “List the top 5 causes of climate change.”  
- Prompt 2 → “Explain each cause in detail.”  
- Prompt 3 → “Summarize into a 1000-word essay with intro and conclusion.”  
This modular approach reduces hallucination, improves structure, and gives you checkpoints to verify accuracy.

**When to Use Prompt Chaining**
- Long research reports
- Multi-step reasoning (financial forecasts, legal summaries)
- Structured workflows (customer journey mapping, educational guides)

Limitation: Models with short context windows (like DistilGPT2, GPT-NeoX-20B) may “forget” earlier steps if the chain grows too long. Larger models (like GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5) handle this far better.

#### Simple Example (LangChain Style):

```
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI()

# Step 1: Generate outline
outline_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Give me 3 bullet points on climate change.")
outline_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=outline_prompt)

# Step 2: Expand outline into essay
essay_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Expand this into a 300-word essay:\n{outline}")
essay_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=essay_prompt)

outline = outline_chain.run({})
essay = essay_chain.run({"outline": outline})
print(essay)
```

➡️ First prompt creates an outline, second prompt expands into an essay.  
This is Prompt Chaining — and it’s especially powerful for business workflows (e.g., first create meeting notes → then turn into action items → then draft emails).
