# Chapter 5: Introduction to LangChain & LangGraph

---

## 🔹 1. Why LangChain?

LangChain is one of the most widely adopted frameworks for building **LLM-powered applications**. While LLMs on their own can generate text, LangChain connects them to:

* **Tools** (like APIs, calculators, databases).
* **Memory** (short-term & long-term).
* **Chains & Agents** (structured multi-step reasoning).

👉 Think of it as the **glue layer** between an LLM and the real world.

## 🔹 2. What About LangGraph?

LangGraph is an extension built by the same team, focused on **agent workflows**.
Where LangChain gives you chains and tool usage, **LangGraph adds state machines and graphs** — ideal for orchestrating **multi-step or multi-agent systems**.

👉 In short:

* **LangChain** → Great for prototyping and connecting models.
* **LangGraph** → Great for scaling to real-world, reliable agent systems.

## 🔹 3. Why This Tutorial Uses LangChain And LangGraph

In this series, our focus is **Agentic AI**. LangChain & LangGraph give us:

* ✅ **Rapid prototyping** (easy chains, tools, prompts).
* ✅ **Production patterns** (memory, state management, graphs).
* ✅ **Community support** (huge ecosystem, tutorials, integrations).

They’re not the only option, but they balance **beginner-friendliness** and **professional depth**.

## 🔹 4. Alternatives You Should Know

Depending on your use case, you might explore:

* **LlamaIndex (GPT Index)** → Strong for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** use cases.
* **Haystack** → Powerful for **search + retrieval pipelines**.
* **Guidance** → Focused on **controlling LLM output formats**.
* **AutoGPT / BabyAGI** → More experimental “autonomous” frameworks.

Each has trade-offs, but LangChain remains the most versatile entry point.

## 🔹 5. Limitations of LangChain / LangGraph

* ⚠️ **Complexity** → Large learning curve for beginners beyond simple chains.
* ⚠️ **Performance** → Agents can be slow/expensive if not optimized (tool overuse, excessive prompts).
* ⚠️ **Still evolving** → APIs change quickly; keeping up with updates is necessary.

## 🔹 6. Prerequisites

Before we jump into our practicals in the next chapter , let’s talk **prerequisites**.

To follow along with LangChain implementations, you should ideally be comfortable with:

*  **Python basics** → writing/understanding simple scripts.
*  **pip** → installing Python packages.
*  **Virtual environments (venv / conda)** → optional but useful to keep projects isolated.
*  **Jupyter / Google Colab** → running Python code in notebooks.

- If you’re new, don’t worry — this module series will provide **ready-to-use Google Colab notebooks** alongside the explanations. That way, you don’t need to set up a full dev environment on your laptop right away.

## 📌 Teaser for Next Chapter

Now that you’ve got LangChain + LangGraph installed and working with Google AI, in the **next article we’ll build our very first Agent from using the Langchian Library**.
