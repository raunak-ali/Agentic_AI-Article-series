## Chapter B:Introduction to LLMs And Free LLM Resources



###  **1. What Are LLMs (Large Language Models)?**

Imagine a system that doesn’t just store information like a database, but can converse, summarize, translate, write code, and even reason through problems. That’s what an LLM (Large Language Model) does.
* To a **business owner**: You can think of them as engines that can draft reports, analyze long documents, summarize meetings, or even generate marketing content at scale,cutting both cost and time.
* To a **student or fresher**: It’s helpful to imagine them as a much smarter autocomplete. They’ve been trained on massive datasets, so they can predict the “next word” in a way that feels surprisingly natural, whether you’re writing code, a paragraph, or even a story.

### **2. How Do LLMs Work (Architecture Basics)**

At the core of most modern LLMs is the **Transformer architecture** (Vaswani et al., 2017). 
Unlike older models that processed text one word at a time, transformers look at whole sequences in parallel and figure out which words matter most to each other. Here are the essentials: 
- **Embeddings** – Words (or tokens) are turned into numerical vectors that capture meaning.
- **Positional Encoding** – Adds information about word order (since transformers don’t read sequentially by default).
- **Self-Attention** – Each word decides which other words in the sentence it should *pay attention* to.
- **Multi-Head Attention** – Multiple attention mechanisms run in parallel, capturing different patterns (syntax, context, semantics).
- **Feed-Forward Layers + Residuals** – Nonlinear layers stacked deep, with shortcut connections to keep training stable.
- **Output Layer** – Predicts the most likely next token, repeating the process to generate full sentences.

That’s the backbone: a stack of transformer blocks working together, with **more layers = more power**.

### **3. Types of LLMs**

* **Decoder-only (GPT-style)** → Text generation, chat, coding.
* **Encoder-only (BERT-style)** → Text classification, embeddings, search.
* **Encoder-Decoder (T5/FLAN-style)** → Translation, summarization, Q\&A.
* **Instruction-tuned models** → Optimized for the following natural language prompts (e.g., Mistral-Instruct, Falcon-Instruct,Gemini).

### **4. Accessing Open-Source LLMs on Hugging Face**

Hugging Face hosts 100,000+ models. Some are fully open, others are **gated**.

- To use **gated models** like Mistral or LLaMA:

1. Visit the model’s page (e.g., [Mistral-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1))
2. Click **“Access repository”** and accept the license.
3. Generate a **Read token** here → [HF Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
4. Authenticate in notebook:

   ```python
   from huggingface_hub import login
   login("YOUR_HF_TOKEN")
   ```

### **5. Running a Free LLM (Google AI Studio)**

Instead of heavy Hugging Face models, you can start quickly with **Google AI Studio** → free API keys, fast responses.

👉 Try it here: [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### **Step 1: Get API Key**

1. Go to [Google AI Studio Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Generate a free API key.
3. Copy it.

### **Step 2: Use in Notebook**

```python
!pip install -q -U google-genai

from google import genai

# The client gets the API key from the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
client = genai.Client(api_key="your_api_key")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash", contents="Explain All about LLMS"
)
print(response.text)
```

### **7. Limitations of Free LLMs**

* **Rate limits** → Free APIs (Google AI, Hugging Face) restrict daily usage.
* **Model size** → Smaller free/open models may give weaker answers vs GPT-4/Gemini Pro.
* **Latency** → Free cloud GPUs can be slow (Colab queues, Hugging Face load times).
* **Privacy** → Using free APIs means your inputs may be logged. For sensitive use cases, local/offline models are safer.
