# üîπ 3. The Reasoning Loop (ReAct Pattern)

## 3.1 The idea 
Most questions need more than a single reply.
Example: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the population of Japan squared?‚Äù

A good agent will:

1. **Think**: I should look up Japan‚Äôs population.
2. **Act**: Call a search/Wikipedia tool.
3. **Observe**: Tool returns ‚Äú\~125,000,000‚Äù.
4. **Answer**: Compute `125,000,000¬≤` and return the result.

That‚Äôs the **ReAct** pattern: **Reason** (Thought) ‚Üî **Act** (use a tool), loop until you can confidently answer. The original paper introduced interleaving ‚Äúreasoning traces‚Äù with ‚Äúactions‚Äù so the model plans, fetches facts, handles errors, and then concludes. ([arXiv][1], [Google Research][2], [ReAct][3])

---

## 3.2 What ReAct looks like under the hood

**Core roles:**

* **Thought**: free-form reasoning the model writes to plan (‚ÄúI need a web lookup‚Äù).
* **Action**: a *structured* tool call (name + arguments).
* **Observation**: tool output fed back to the model as new context.
* **Answer**: final, user-facing result; loop stops here.

**Why interleave?**
Reasoning helps the model decide *which* tool, *when*, and *how* to use it; acting gets fresh facts or runs computations the model can‚Äôt ‚Äúguess.‚Äù This synergy reliably beats ‚Äújust think‚Äù or ‚Äújust act.‚Äù ([arXiv][1], [Google Research][2])

**In LangChain/LangGraph terms:**

* A **tool** is a function/API (with a name, schema, and description) the model can call.
* A **ReAct agent** is an LLM loop that keeps selecting tools and ingesting observations until a stop condition (final answer, guardrail, or max steps).
* **LangGraph** wraps this as a compiled **graph** with state, nodes (LLM, Tool), and edges controlling the loop. The prebuilt helper is `create_react_agent`. ([LangChain AI][4])

## 3.3 Anatomy of a ReAct agent prompt (practical)

A solid ReAct system prompt tells the model:

* What it is solving.
* Which tools exist (names + when to use them).
* How to emit **Action** calls (structured).
* When to stop and give **Final Answer**.

*Sketch:*

```
You are a reasoning agent. When needed, use tools.
If you can answer directly, do so.
Otherwise follow: 
Thought: ...
Action: {"tool": "<name>", "tool_input": "<args>"}
Observation: <tool output here>
... repeat ...
Final Answer: <concise answer>
```

LangChain‚Äôs modern stack handles the JSON/tool-call formatting for you; you mainly provide tool descriptions and keep the prompt crisp. (LangChain‚Äôs legacy ReAct chain is marked deprecated; new work should use LangGraph.) ([LangChain][5])

## 3.4 How LangGraph runs the loop

At a high level:

```
state = { messages: [...], scratchpad: [] }

while not done:
  llm_output = LLM(state)
  if llm_output contains tool_call:
      tool = tools[tool_call.name]
      obs  = tool(tool_call.args)
      state.messages += [("tool", obs)]
  else:
      done = True
      state.answer = llm_output
```

* **State** carries messages (user, assistant, tool) and any scratchpad/variables.
* The prebuilt **`create_react_agent`** wires an LLM node + Tool node + a controller loop, with sensible stop conditions and max iterations. ([LangChain AI][4])

## 3.5 Tiny working example (Gemini + Search + Python ‚Äúcalculator‚Äù)

This mirrors the ‚ÄúJapan population squared‚Äù example. We use:

* **DuckDuckGo search tool** to fetch population (no key needed).
* **Python REPL tool** to square the number.
* **LangGraph `create_react_agent`** to run the ReAct loop.

```python
# Install
!pip install -qU langchain langgraph langchain-google-genai langchain-community

import os
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, PythonREPLTool
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

# 1) LLM (Gemini)
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro", temperature=0)

# 2) Tools
search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()   # web search (fetch facts)
python = PythonREPLTool()        # safe eval; prints result for return

tools = [search, python]

# 3) ReAct Agent (LangGraph)
agent = create_react_agent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=tools,
    # Optional: nudge the model to use tools sparingly and show work
    state_modifier=(
        "Use tools only when needed. "
        "When math is required, write a short plan, then call Python. "
        "Cite what you looked up. Return a Final Answer when done."
    ),
)

# 4) Run
question = "What is the population of Japan squared? Provide the final number only."
events = agent.stream({"messages": [("user", question)]})
for e in events:
    print(e)  # You'll see Thought/Action/Observation/Answer-like steps
```

Notes:

* **DuckDuckGo tool**: simple, fast, often enough for headline facts. For a Wikipedia-only version, use `WikipediaAPIWrapper` + `WikipediaQueryRun` from LangChain community tools. ([LangChain][6])
* **Python REPL** returns only what‚Äôs printed. Make sure the agent prints its result in tool code. (LangChain‚Äôs Python REPL docs explain this caveat.) ([LangChain][7])

---

## 3.6 Design tips (so it doesn‚Äôt fall apart)

* **Tool descriptions matter**: be explicit about *when* to use each tool. The model‚Äôs choice quality tracks the clarity of these descriptions. (This is why ReAct prompts include precise, minimal instructions.) ([LangChain][8])
* **Guardrails**: set max tool calls/steps and timeouts; log traces (LangSmith) when you go production. ([LangChain][9])
* **Latency & cost**: each tool hop adds delay. Prefer one high-signal lookup over many tiny calls. Cache frequent lookups.
* **Numerical reliability**: route math to Python/Calculator; don‚Äôt trust raw LLM arithmetic. ([LangChain][7])
* **Traceability**: ReAct is popular because you can *see* the chain of Thought/Action/Observation, which helps audits and debugging. ([arXiv][1])

---

## 3.7 The ‚ÄúJapan population squared‚Äù explained (end-to-end)

* **Thought**: ‚ÄúI need current population.‚Äù
* **Action**: call `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` with a query like *‚ÄúJapan population‚Äù*.
* **Observation**: search snippet returns a value (e.g., \~125,000,000).
* **Action**: call `PythonREPLTool` with `print(125_000_000**2)`.
* **Observation**: `15625000000000000`.
* **Answer**: return the number (with optional citation note).

This is the exact loop you‚Äôll see in the stream output from the example above. ([LangChain][6])
