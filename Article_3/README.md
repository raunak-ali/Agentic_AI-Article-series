Perfect, we’re moving into the **fun part of agentic AI** — using tools and chaining them in LangGraph. Your draft plan is solid, but I’d refine the scope and structure so that it’s consistent with Article 1 and 2, while also setting up for deeper projects later.

Here’s how I’d reframe **Article 3** into a complete, clear outline:

---

# Article 3: Multi-Step Agentic Workflows with Tools

## 🔹 1. Introduction

* Recap: In Article 2 we built a single-node agent.
* Motivation: Why single agents aren’t enough → real-world queries often require external knowledge, calculations, or multiple steps.
* Transition line: Tools are what make agents “do things” beyond just generating text.

---

## 🔹 2. What Are Tools in LangChain?

* Definition: Functions or APIs that the LLM can call during reasoning.
* Types of tools:

  * **Built-in** (Python REPL, Calculator).
  * **APIs** (Wikipedia search, SerpAPI, custom APIs).
  * **Custom functions** (you define your own).
* Limitations:

  * Over-reliance on tools = latency + cost.
  * LLM needs clear instructions on when to use them.

📖 Reference: LangChain Tools Documentation

## 🔹 3. The Reasoning Loop (ReAct Pattern)

* Explain **Thought → Action → Observation → Answer**.
* Show how agents decide:

  * *Thought:* “I need to look up Japan’s population.”
  * *Action:* Use Wikipedia API.
  * *Observation:* “Population = 125 million.”
  * *Answer:* “Square = 15,625,000,000,000.”
* Importance: Ensures interpretability (we see *why* an agent chose a tool).

---

## 🔹 4. LangGraph + Tools = Multi-Step Workflows

* Explain how LangGraph handles this better than plain LangChain:

  * Nodes = LLM or tools.
  * Edges = control flow.
  * State = carries intermediate observations.
* Advantage: **Visualization + Debugging** → you can actually *see* the chain of steps.
* Warning: More steps = higher chance of error; must design carefully.

---

## 🔹 5. Example Tools We’ll Use

* **Wikipedia API** → fetch structured knowledge.
* **Python REPL / Calculator** → perform numeric operations.
* Show how to install and configure them.
* Note on API keys: Wikipedia = free, others may require tokens.

---

## 🔹 6. Implementation: Knowledge + Math Agent

* Query: “What’s the population of Japan squared?”
* Workflow:

  1. User Input → LLM agent.
  2. Agent decides to call **Wikipedia API**.
  3. Wikipedia returns population.
  4. Agent calls **Python tool** to square it.
  5. Agent outputs final answer.
* Visualization in LangGraph Studio.
* Edge cases: What if Wikipedia gives multiple values? (disambiguation handling).

---

## 🔹 7. Practical: Build in Jupyter Notebook

* Full code (step-by-step like in Article 2).
* Define tools, register them, and add them as nodes.
* Show how the agent moves between nodes automatically.
* Run example query + show intermediate reasoning steps.
* Visualize graph execution.

---

## 🔹 8. Why This Matters for Businesses & Developers

* Businesses → Automating reports, research, calculations.
* Students → Building projects that “actually do things” instead of just text generation.
* Warning: Tools need guardrails (don’t let agents run arbitrary code without limits).

---

## 🔹 9. Teaser for Next Article

* Article 4 → **Multi-Agent Systems**.
* “One agent with tools is powerful. But what if multiple specialized agents collaborated, each with its own skills? That’s where we’re heading next.”

---

👉 This flow keeps the **progressive learning arc**:

* Article 1 → Basics (GenAI, LLMs, Prompting).
* Article 2 → Single-agent LangGraph.
* Article 3 → Multi-step workflows with tools.
* Article 4 → Multi-agent collaboration.

Do you want me to **start drafting Chapter 1 + 2 of Article 3** (Intro + What Are Tools in LangChain) right now, so we build it piece by piece like we did earlier?
